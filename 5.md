# Lab 5: Essential Static Analysis Tools

This lab introduces tools for analyzing executable files without running them. While tools like PEStudio are primarily GUI-based, command-line equivalents or complementary tools from Sysinternals are often used for automation and detailed analysis.

---

## 1. PEStudio (Conceptual)

* **Description**: PEStudio is a free, powerful static analysis tool for Windows Portable Executable (PE) files. It quickly assesses a file's trustworthiness by extracting and checking various indicators like imported libraries, functions, digital signatures, and embedded resources.
* **Key actions you'd perform in the GUI**:
    * Load a suspicious executable.
    * Review indicators (red/yellow flags for suspicious traits).
    * Examine imported DLLs and functions (APIs).
    * Check for embedded strings.
    * Verify digital signatures (or absence thereof).
    * Look at compilation information (timestamps, compiler used).
    * Analyze sections and their characteristics.

## 2. Sysinternals Suite (Command-line examples)

Sysinternals provides a range of powerful utilities for Windows system monitoring and troubleshooting. You'd typically download and run these executables directly.

* ### `strings.exe` (Extracting Human-Readable Strings)
    * **Purpose**: Extracts Unicode and ASCII strings from binary files, which can reveal paths, URLs, error messages, or configuration data embedded in malware.
    * **Command**:
        ```bash
        # On Windows, navigate to the directory where strings.exe is located
        # or add it to your system PATH.
        .\strings.exe C:\Path\To\Suspicious.exe > extracted_strings.txt

        # Example with common options
        .\strings.exe -nobanner -n 8 C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe | more
        # -nobanner: Don't display the Sysinternals banner
        # -n 8: Minimum string length is 8 characters
        ```
* ### `sigcheck.exe` (Verifying Digital Signatures)
    * **Purpose**: Verifies the digital signatures of files, reports version information, and shows if a file has been tampered with or is unsigned. Crucial for identifying legitimate software vs. unsigned malware.
    * **Command**:
        ```bash
        # Check signature of a system DLL
        .\sigcheck.exe C:\Windows\System32\kernel32.dll

        # Check signature of a suspicious executable (replace with actual path)
        .\sigcheck.exe C:\Path\To\Suspicious.exe

        # Recursively check files in a directory
        .\sigcheck.exe -e -u -h C:\Windows\System32\ > system32_signatures.txt
        # -e: Check executable images only
        # -u: If the file is unsigned or has an invalid signature
        # -h: Show file hashes
        ```
* ### `Process Explorer` (GUI - Process and DLL Inspection)
    * **Purpose**: A highly advanced task manager that shows detailed information about processes, including loaded DLLs, open handles, and threads. Useful for identifying suspicious processes or loaded malicious modules.
    * **Usage**: Run `procexp.exe` (no command-line direct usage for core analysis, but can be started from CLI).
* ### `Process Monitor` (GUI - Real-time File System, Registry, Process/Thread Activity)
    * **Purpose**: Captures real-time file system, Registry, and process/thread activity. Invaluable for dynamic analysis to see what a program does when it runs.
    * **Usage**: Run `procmon.exe` (no command-line direct usage for core analysis, but can be started from CLI).
