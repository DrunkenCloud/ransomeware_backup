# Lab 6: Extracting Strings & Hashes

This lab focuses on two fundamental static analysis techniques: extracting human-readable strings from binaries and calculating cryptographic hashes for file identification.

## 1. Extracting Strings

* **Concept**: Binary files (like executables, DLLs, etc.) often contain embedded human-readable text that can provide clues about their functionality, configuration, or origin. These can include URLs, IP addresses, error messages, hardcoded passwords, or file paths.

* **Commands/Tools**:

    * ### `strings` (on Linux/macOS)
        * **Purpose**: Extracts printable character sequences from files.
        * **Command**:
            ```bash
            # Basic usage: Extract strings from a binary file
            strings /bin/ls

            # Extract strings from a suspicious file and save to output
            strings suspicious_malware.bin > malware_strings.txt

            # Filter for specific patterns (e.g., URLs)
            strings suspicious_malware.bin | grep "http"

            # Specify minimum string length (e.g., at least 5 characters)
            strings -n 5 suspicious_malware.bin
            ```

    * ### `strings.exe` (Sysinternals - on Windows)
        * **Purpose**: Same as the Linux `strings` utility, but for Windows.
        * **Command**: (See Lab 5 for examples; usage is identical)
            ```bash
            .\strings.exe C:\Path\To\Malware.exe > malware_strings.txt
            ```

## 2. Calculating Hashes

* **Concept**: A cryptographic hash function takes an input (e.g., a file) and produces a fixed-size string of bytes, known as a hash value or message digest. Even a tiny change in the input file will result in a drastically different hash. Hashes are crucial for:
    * **File identification**: Uniquely identify a specific version of a file.
    * **Integrity checking**: Verify if a file has been altered.
    * **Threat intelligence**: Check if a file's hash matches known malware databases (e.g., VirusTotal).
* **Common Hash Algorithms**: MD5, SHA1, SHA256 (SHA256 is generally preferred for security due to MD5/SHA1 collisions).

* **Commands/Tools**:

    * ### `md5sum` (on Linux/macOS)
        * **Purpose**: Calculates the MD5 hash of a file.
        * **Command**:
            ```bash
            md5sum my_document.pdf
            md5sum /bin/ls
            ```

    * ### `sha256sum` (on Linux/macOS)
        * **Purpose**: Calculates the SHA256 hash of a file.
        * **Command**:
            ```bash
            sha256sum my_executable.bin
            sha256sum /etc/passwd
            ```

    * ### PowerShell (on Windows)
        * **Purpose**: Built-in commands to calculate hashes for files.
        * **Command**:
            ```powershell
            # Calculate SHA256 hash of a file
            Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -Path "C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe"

            # Calculate MD5 hash
            Get-FileHash -Algorithm MD5 -Path "C:\Path\To\MyFile.txt"

            # Get all supported algorithms
            Get-FileHash -Algorithm * -Path "C:\Path\To\MyFile.txt"
            ```

    * ### CertUtil (on Windows Command Prompt/CMD)
        * **Purpose**: Can also be used to calculate file hashes, though PowerShell's `Get-FileHash` is often preferred.
        * **Command**:
            ```cmd
            certutil -hashfile "C:\Windows\System32\kernel32.dll" MD5
            certutil -hashfile "C:\Windows\System32\kernel32.dll" SHA256
            ```
